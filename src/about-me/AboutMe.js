          <h2 className="text-center">Hi, I am Brookzerker</h2>
          <p>I am a Streamer, teacher, game maker, and a all around technologist. Currently I have a day job as a Lead Instructor at <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/denver-golden-triangle" target="_blank">Galvanize</a> for their Full-Stack Immersive program. Before I was programming I was doing systems administration as a contractor at NASA Advanced Supercomputing at NASA Ames Research center.</p>
          <p>In my free time I enjoy streaming myself programming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker" target="_blank">Twitch.tv</a> as I make and learn cool new things. I'm also creating videos for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT1-XRVnJA-wws2bfbLbFcQ?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank">YouTube.</a></p>
          <p>Take a look below at the archive of videos and projects that I have worked on. Happy coding!</p>
