        "longDescription": "Screeps is an MMORTS game where the only way to play is to code JavaScript. It is MMO in that many many players have their code running at the same time. And it is an RTS in the way that the player must create a home base, and many other buildings as well as the units to defend, attack, and grow an economy. I play this game every once in awhile on and off stream."
