          <h2 className="text-center">Hi, I'm Brookzerker</h2>
          <p>I'm a Streamer, teacher, game maker, and an all around technologist. Currently I have a day job as a Lead Instructor at <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/denver-golden-triangle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galvanize</a> for their Full-Stack Immersive Web Development program. Before I was programming I was a contract systems administrator at the NAS (NASA Advanced Supercomputing) center.</p>
          <p>In my free time I enjoy streaming while programming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch.tv</a> as I make and learn cool new things, including art with code, games, and advanced algorithms. I've been known to play a game or two while streaming as well. I've begun archiving some of my streams to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT1-XRVnJA-wws2bfbLbFcQ?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube.</a></p>
          <p>A list of the last few streams that I've created can be seen to the right, and videos of specific projects or games can be seen in the projects below!</p>
